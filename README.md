# FastAPI Tutorial for Beginners

Welcome to the FastAPI tutorial series repository! In this repository, you will find the code examples and resources used in our YouTube series on FastAPI. This tutorial series will help you get started with FastAPI, a modern and fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git https://github.com/kapousa/BasicsOfFastAPI.git
   cd fastapi-tutorial
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the application in action.

## Code Examples

### Basic FastAPI Application

Create a file named `main.py` and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

### Adding More Routes and Features

Update `main.py` to include additional routes:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```
